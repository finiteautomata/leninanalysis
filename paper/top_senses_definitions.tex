    \multicolumn{3}{p{\linewidth}}{Top-senses for each work are shown on the first column. The gloss that our algorithm calculated is on the second column. Third column shows the closest handpicked sense using path distance. On imperialism notice the appareance of hair.n.01 and the matched sense universe.n.01. On Materialism and Empirio-criticism first sense was matched with experience.n.03. Note that many synsets were close to law.n.04 (TODO: necesito mostrar esto en la tabla usando los top7 creo)} \\
