        \multicolumn{5}{p{\linewidth}}{The table shows $top-senses$ obtained from the choosen works. Each $top-sense$ is ordered according to the information value score that we obtained previous to apply the $WSD$ algorithm. Most of the senses found by our algorithm were the senses related to the works, except for some of them. On Whats is to be done? local\_anesthetic was matched as sense. On State and revolution Marx was matched with a United States comedian and the same result we got with Berstein that was matched with a composer} \\
