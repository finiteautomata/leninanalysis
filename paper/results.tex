For each work we executed the algorithm and then we obtained five different similarities for the top senses.
We compared the similarity of top sense against each other and against a list handpicked synsets \ref{handpicked_synsets}

First we show the results obtained after the execution for some works , then we analyze the results of similarity.

In the next Table we can observe the best top sense matches for our handpicked synsets.
\input{analysis_the_state_and_revolution}

After a careful analysis of out results we found some problems with pronouns that we show in \ref{table:pronouns}
We think that this mismatch could be a cause of our Lesk algorithm modification to check against to context words directly.

\begin{table}[h!]

        \begin{tabular}{ | L{3cm} | L{1cm} | L{3cm} |}

            \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Strange detections} \\ \hline

One interesting thing to observe is the distance between the all the top senses of all texts.

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{lch_sim_graph.png}
    \label{fig:lch_sim_graph}
\end{figure}



Now our question is. how far are the top senses from the concepts we wanted to compare to?
To answer that question we find interesting to study what happens if we add pylosophical, political and economic senses in out graph and calculate form those synsets the similarity to top senses.



\begin{figure}[h!]
    \caption{Top senses against economy philosophy and politics using LCH similarity}

    \label{fig:phyl_eco_pol_lch_sim_graph}
\end{figure}

At ~\ref{fig:phyl_eco_pol_lch_sim_graph} we notw that the synsets phylosophy, economic and politics are very close to each other

We tried several similarity measures and most of them gave that phylosophy, economic and politics are similar synsets.
However when we tried JCN similarity we found that those synsets were far enough from each other \ref{fig:phyl_eco_pol_jcn_sim_graph}. We can\'t get any concise results since nodes in \ref{fig:phyl_eco_pol_jcn_sim_graph} seems to be very dispersed.
